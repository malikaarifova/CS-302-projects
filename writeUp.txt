Summary - We both contributed a fair amount to the best of our abilities. We usually met up in person at the library and worked on the project 
simultaneously. We had several problems with setting up the github at first, but we were able to get the TAs to help us out during our separate 
lab times. It was a little hard dividing up the work because this we weren't sure of what to do at first. However, we were able to figure it 
out after drawing out an outline and following the writeup. We divided up the different steps and the comments on the project. 
We worked pretty well together on the project but we definitely need improvements on our teamwork skills.
